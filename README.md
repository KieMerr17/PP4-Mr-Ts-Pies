## Design

### Colours

I chose dark colours, mainly black and white with other colours which are slight variations as the company colours are predominately black and white. I added in the colour orange to buttons to give it a warmer feeling and to add some modernness to it.

The colors I wanted to stay close to  [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)
<details><summary>See colour pallet</summary>

### Lighthouse

Performance, best practices and SEO was tested using Lighthouse.

**I had alot of issues trying to get the lighthouse report on my computer, i had to seek help and get some screenshots sent over to me to show me the reports. Ended up with a complete mixture of results ranging in performance and mixed scores for the same page. I have attached both screenshots from my computer (light theme) and the ones sent to me (dark theme).
**Low performance score is due to the use of images and data being stored on third party hosting sites, images (Cloudinary) and data (elephantSQL) needing to be pulled to site.
